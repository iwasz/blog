Just a quick update for those who are interested if this project is still alive. It is. Above you can find an early test video from the application which runs on a PC and does post processing of the data collected by raspberry pi. More details to come in next post. All source code for this project is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/motoblackbox/">here</a> (work in progress). First post <a href="http://www.iwasz.pl/electronics/motorcycle-black-box-part-1-data-acquisition-with-arduino-mega/" title="Motorcycle black box. Part 1 : data acquisition with Arduino Mega.">here</a>.
